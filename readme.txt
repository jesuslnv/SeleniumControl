# Selenium Control

This is a base project to use as "Base Library" in your main Selenium Projects which simplifies the declaration and use of web components.

## Getting Started

This project doesn't run anything by itself but you can compile and use it as a base library to call different components in your Selenium Web Testing:
* Components
  * Page
	[x] Switch To Specific Tab using Name
	[x] Switch To Last Tab
	[x] Verify File Downloaded Correctly
	[x] Wait for Modal
	[x] Wait for Page Load
	
  * Control
	[x] Set X Position (Moves the view in axis "X")
	[x] Set Y Position (Moves the view in axis "Y")
	[x] Is Control Exist (Validates if the Control exist in the view)
	[x] Drag And Drop (Allows to Drag and Drop elements in the view) 
	[x] Mouse Hover (Locates the mouse in specified Xpath)
